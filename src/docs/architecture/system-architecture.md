System Architecture â€“ TechFix AI
Overview

TechFix AI is a platform designed to assist technicians, learners, and repair professionals by providing device schematics, repair solutions, and AI-assisted guidance. The system integrates a web-based frontend, a REST API backend, a document/database layer, and an AI/ML recommendation engine.

Components

Frontend (React + TypeScript + Vite)

Provides user interface for browsing schematics, uploading solutions, and searching repair guides.

Uses React Query/Zustand for state management.

Authenticated routes for technicians and admins.

Backend (Node.js + Express)

REST API for user management, solutions, and repair data.

Handles authentication and authorization (JWT, role-based).

Manages file uploads (schematics, repair docs, media).

Database (MongoDB)

Stores users, device models, repair logs, solutions, and metadata.

Flexible schema to support multiple device types (phones, laptops, tablets).

Supports indexing for fast search/filtering.

AI/ML Layer (OpenAI API + Custom Models)

AI-powered repair assistant that analyzes uploaded issues.

Suggests possible fixes based on stored knowledge.

Future support for:

OCR/vision models for board schematics.

Predictive failure analysis.

Storage/CDN (Cloudinary / AWS S3 / Firebase Storage) (optional)

For storing large assets (images, videos, schematics PDFs).

Integrated with backend upload system.
